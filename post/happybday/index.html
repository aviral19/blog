      <p>What happens when you are afraid to post on your best friend&rsquo;s facebook timeline,
well you creepy fuck, you write it on your personal blog.
Umm, how should I begin ?
Let it be a question and answer roumd. Kind of like the rapid fire one.</p>

<p><em>1.) When did Pandey become your friend ?</em><br />
Oh that is easy, well let us see, <em>oh fuck you don&rsquo;t remember do you</em>.<br />
Wait I do - It was way back in class 6th I guess.
Pandey was in section <strong>A</strong>, and she became friend with Rythm, my then crush.
Pandey wasn&rsquo;t a direct friend, she became my friend through Rythm.<br />
We used to tell Pandey about our tales of mischief, and our common friend Siddhant.
So yeah, I would say, class 6th.</p>

<p><em>2.) When did you guys come close ?</em><br />
Why the fuck are you interested in my personal life so much. I mean how does it
matters to you.
<em>Boy you don&rsquo;t ask the questions around here, I do</em><br />
Okay, this would be class 8th, Rhythm had left the school.<br />
But I had this attachment to Pandey, it was some pleasure she gave me, she still does.<br />
She is undoubtedly cute, you always want to keep one cute friend just in case you&rsquo;re
single, dying alone at 40, you can marry her then.</p>

<p><em>3.) Why did you never propose Pandey, if you had a crush on her ?</em>
Okay so you will go all personal on me then, here you go.
I obviously had a crush on Pandey, I mean don&rsquo;t get to see such beauty around,
I never could approach her initially due to Rhythm, well she was my first love.
And to be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t sort of those &lsquo;rangbaaz&rsquo; kids out there.
I was the one with oil on his head, pants quite up his waist, and more like a nerd you can say.
I don&rsquo;t deny being a nerd, and nor has it let me to a downfall, but it does loses you some opportunities. (gains you some as well.)</p>

<p><em>4.) When did you realize you can never ask her out now ?</em>
It can be called class 10th I suppose. I mean we were so close to be called a relationship
by everyone else, but we knew we were &lsquo;only friends&rsquo;, and it was perfect, I could not even dare
to lose such a beautiful relationship. And even I was &lsquo;lite&rsquo; by then, Pandey was someone who understood me like no other, I was the Prefect of Su-ur house by then (I still wonder why don&rsquo;t they call the houses by their color name - simple <strong>Red House</strong>).<br />
Pandey did a lot of work for Su-ur house, and hence we came close, we came close like no other.
And then I had a crush on Surabhi (again all that nerdiness stopped me), and Pandey knew about it, that strengthened our bond like no other.</p>

<p><em>5.) All that is cool, do you still love her ? Like do you want her as your girlfriend ?</em>
I would say <strong>No</strong> to this.
I mean a guy would be more than lucky to have Pandey by his side, I just know her too well, to be in a relationship with her.
A relationship is more like a puzzle you solve, layer by layer, by showering your love and gaining trust.
Pandey already has my utmost trust and I have hers. Also, now I don&rsquo;t sexually feel about Pandey.<br />
<em>But I have seen you looking at her breasts sometimes.. tsk. tsk.</em><br />
Will you please shut the fuck up, it was long long ago, and I am a guy, every guy does this.<br />
And well, she has a beauty, why wouldn&rsquo;t someone not want to admire her. You just have a very vague and rude way of saying things.</p>

<p><em>6.) Where do you see all of this heading ?</em>
If I have to keep a friend like Pandey, I would keep her till eternity.
You don&rsquo;t get such friends in real life. Sometimes I do think if Pandey is just my hallicunation.
Well when others confirm that hallicunation it becomes a reality, and Pandey is that amazing reality which happened to me.<br />
She has been with me through all my ups and downs, she has given me space when I was in a relationship, she has been throughout with me when I broke up, she was there with me when I got into BITS.<br />
<strong>And here she is with me, right in the messenger box, waiting for my reply, thinking I am working with some senior, and here I am, a fool, writing all this and making her wait</strong>
It is me who could write books about her, entire memoirs, maybe a day will come.</p>

<p><em>This post will be deleted at 20th July 00:00</em>
I will have a archive though.</p>
